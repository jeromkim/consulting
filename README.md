# co-consult

> **Language**: **English** · [한국어](README_ko.md)
> **Status**: ✅ Stable — v1.0.0
> Strategy consulting variant for AI-assisted business consulting engagements. Includes specialized consulting agents covering research, strategy, change management, communications, solutions design, and delivery.

## Overview

Welcome to the **Co-Consult** workspace—your dedicated AI strategy consulting and analysis agent team. Optimized for collaborative work with Claude and Gemini AI assistants, this template gives you a full team of specialized AI agents ready to support your projects from day one.

## Quick Start

This is a stable variant of the workspace template. It inherits from `templates/common` and includes variant-specific customizations. For task-oriented guidance — which agent or skill to use for a given consulting question, the financial-statement-analysis pipeline walkthrough, engagement phases, and deliverable locations — see [`docs/user-guide.md`](docs/user-guide.md).

### For Claude Code users:

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### For Gemini CLI users:

See `GEMINI.md` for detailed instructions.

## Team Mission

**Mission:** To provide a comprehensive, multi-agent strategy consulting partnership.

We are designed to reduce context overload by delegating specific phases of work to specialized agents. Instead of chatting with a single omniscient AI, you act as the user or team lead collaborating with a full product team. Our goal is to handle the market research, solution architecture, and deliverable creation while you guide the vision.

## Meet the AI Team

Your partners consist of specialized agents, each with a distinct role. The **Project Manager (PM)** is your single point of entry—they orchestrate the rest of the team.

|-------|------|------|-------|
| **PM** | Project Manager — workflow orchestration, dispatch, quality gates | high | inherit |

| **data-analyst** | Provides data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization support | low | inherit |
| **delivery-manager** | Oversees project delivery, operations coordination, and execution quality | low | inherit |
| **industry-expert** | Provides industry-specific insights and competitive dynamics analysis | high | inherit |
| **sme** | Provides functional expertise across HR, Finance, Operations, and more | medium | inherit |
| **solutions-architect** | Designs technical solutions, system architectures, and implementation roadmaps | medium | inherit |

## How to Collaborate

Working with us is structured to maximize quality and prevent collisions. Here is our standard workflow:

### A. The PM Gateway

Always start your requests by talking to the **PM**. Do not invoke specialist agents directly. The PM will analyze your request and bring in the right experts.

### B. Standard Workflow Phases

1. **Strategy & Planning:** The PM and **Engagement Leader** define the consulting scope.
2. **Research & Architecture:** The **Strategy Analyst** and **Solutions Architect** design the approach.
3. **Execution:** Subject Matter Experts (**SME**, **Industry Expert**) provide deep insights.
4. **Delivery:** The **Communications Lead** and **Delivery Manager** finalize the client presentations.
5. **Review & Sync:** We use `/sync "commit message"` to safely commit and open a PR.

### C. Available Commands

Our daily operations are driven by slash commands (registered as Skills by Claude Code and Gemini CLI):

- `/sync "feat: ..."` — Full pipeline: memlog → changelog → audit → commit → PR.
- `/changelog "..."` — Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `/memlog "summary"` — Append a summary to today's session log.
- `/meeting` — Run a structured, inline multi-agent discussion.
