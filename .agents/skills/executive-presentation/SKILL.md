## Context

Use in Phase 3 when producing the primary client-facing presentation. Prerequisites (technical-feasibility, org-readiness-assessment, financial-modeling) must be complete before this skill is invoked.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when the Communications Lead is ready to design and build the executive strategy deck for C-level stakeholders. All three prerequisite skill outputs must be available before execution begins.

## Execution Steps

1. **Confirm Prerequisites**: Verify outputs from technical-feasibility, org-readiness-assessment, and financial-modeling are available
2. **Define the Decision**: What single decision must the executive audience make after this presentation?
3. **Pyramid Principle Structure**: SCQA framework
   - Situation: What is the current context the audience already knows?
   - Complication: What has changed or is threatening?
   - Question: What does this situation force us to ask?
   - Answer: The recommendation (stated upfront, not at the end)
4. **Slide Architecture** (standard executive deck):
   - Title slide + Agenda (1 slide)
   - Executive Summary / Recommendation (1-2 slides) — written last
   - Context and Problem (2-3 slides)
   - Analysis and Findings (3-5 slides, sourced from insight-synthesis)
   - Business Case (2-3 slides, sourced from financial-modeling + technical-feasibility + org-readiness-assessment):
     - Investment summary
     - Expected returns (NPV/IRR)
     - Key risks and mitigations
     - Change management cost summary
   - Recommended Path Forward (2-3 slides)
   - Next Steps and Decision Request (1 slide)
5. **One-Page Summary Design**: Distill entire presentation into 1 page: Situation (2 sentences), Recommendation (1 sentence), Business Case (3 bullets), Next Step (1 action)
6. **Executive Language Check**: No jargon, every number has context, every slide has one message, no slide exceeds 5 bullet points

## Output Format

- Slide deck (outline with: slide title, key message per slide, supporting evidence, visual recommendation)
- One-Page Executive Summary (standalone)
- Speaker notes for key slides

> **Save Output To**: See Output Destination Mapping in `docs/co-consult.context.md` for destination folder and naming convention. Create the folder if it does not exist. Do not hard-code output paths.
