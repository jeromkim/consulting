## Context

Use in Phase 3 whenever a formal consulting deliverable (strategy report, assessment, recommendation memo) is being produced. The narrative-framework skill should be completed before this skill is invoked.

## When to Use

- When producing any formal client-facing consulting deliverable
- When structuring a strategy report, assessment, or recommendation memo
- When recommendations need to be prioritized and sequenced for a client
- When the engagement reaches the deliverable production stage in Phase 3

## Execution Steps

1. **Apply Issue Tree Structure**:
   - Start from the central question (the client's decision)
   - Decompose into MECE sub-questions (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
   - Each section of the report answers one branch of the issue tree

2. **Section Architecture** (standard consulting report structure):
   - Executive Summary (1-2 pages): findings, conclusions, recommendations — written last, placed first
   - Situation / Context (1-2 pages): what is true today
   - Complication / Problem (1-2 pages): why the status quo is not acceptable
   - Resolution / Recommendations (3-5 pages): what should be done, in what order
   - Implementation Roadmap (1-2 pages): phased actions with owners and timelines
   - Appendix: supporting data, methodology, detailed analysis

3. **MECE Check**: Review each section. Ask: Do the sections overlap? Do they together cover the full scope?

4. **Recommendation Framing**: Each recommendation must have:
   - What (specific action)
   - Why (evidence-backed rationale)
   - How (implementation approach)
   - Who (owner)
   - When (timeline)
   - Impact-Feasibility Matrix: plot each recommendation on a 2x2 (Impact × Feasibility) to prioritize

5. **Language Standards**:
   - Active voice, present tense for recommendations
   - Quantify every claim where possible ("20% cost reduction" not "significant cost reduction")
   - One idea per paragraph, topic sentence first
   - No jargon without definition

6. **Visual Communication**: Every data point should have a chart or table. Every complex argument should have a visual framework.

7. **Quality Checks**:
   - MECE compliance across all sections
   - So-What statement present per section
   - Evidence backing every claim
   - Executive summary matches body conclusions

## Output Format

- **Full consulting report** in the section structure above
- **Recommendation Prioritization Matrix** (Impact × Feasibility)
- **Executive Summary** (standalone, max 2 pages)
