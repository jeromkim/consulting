## Environment Setup

<!-- VARIANT-INJECT: environment-setup [REQUIRED] -->
- Copy `.env.sample` → `.env` and fill in all required values.
- Required env keys (see `.env.sample`): *(fill in after project creation)*
- The `proposal-writing` skill's `.pptx` rendering uses `pptxgenjs` (a project dependency - `bun install` pulls it in automatically). Optional: LibreOffice installed locally enables the `pptx-to-pdf.ts` PDF export step.
<!-- END VARIANT-INJECT -->

Client brief / task received
  —
/sync "feat: description"
  —
  1. audit.ts — abort on failure
  2. memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — session log (4-section format)
  3. MEMORY.md index update
  4. git add -A → commit
  5. pr/<date>-<slug> branch created (if on main)
  6. git push + gh pr create

<!-- VARIANT-INJECT: guidelines [REQUIRED] -->
## Consulting Guidelines

### Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Evidence-Driven** | All recommendations grounded in data and validated research |
| **Client-Centric** | Deliverables tailored to client's audience and decision context |
| **Structured Communication** | Complex insights synthesized into clear, actionable outputs |
| **Stakeholder Alignment** | Inclusive review processes and executive-level engagement |
| **Change-Aware** | Organizational readiness and culture factored into every recommendation |

### Rules

1. Start every engagement with research — document sources before drafting recommendations.
2. All client deliverables must pass the Phase 2 approval gate before execution.
3. Archive source materials alongside final artifacts.
4. Use consistent templates and formatting for all client-facing deliverables.
5. All PR titles, bodies, and branch names must be in **English**.

<!-- END VARIANT-INJECT -->

---

## Computational Integrity

All numeric outputs in deliverables (aggregations, statistics, percentages, metrics) must be computed by executed code (bun/TypeScript scripts) — never by the AI performing arithmetic directly. High-precision or safety-critical domains (Class A: aerospace, precision control, regulated finance) require validated external tools. See `docs/context.md` § Computational Integrity Standards for the full policy; label AI estimates **approximate**.

---


## File Organization Policy

### Recommended Folder Structure (co-consult)

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `deliverables/reports/` | Final deliverables, client-ready reports |
| `deliverables/drafts/` | Work-in-progress documents and drafts |
| `deliverables/research/` | Research findings, analytical outputs, data analysis results |
| `deliverables/references/` | Reference materials, source archives, citations, supporting documents |
| `deliverables/presentations/` | Client presentation decks |
| `deliverables/proposals/` | Pre-sales proposal drafts and rendered final proposals for prospective clients |
| `memory/` | Session logs, meeting transcripts |

> **Note**: The `deliverables/` subdirectories and their README.md files are created automatically during project scaffolding.

### Output Destination Mapping

Each agent must save its deliverables to the designated folder with the specified naming convention. `{topic}` is derived from the engagement subject or client brief.

**Language Convention**: The deliverable language follows the active country profile (KR default: **Korean**). Korean-language files use the `_ko.md` suffix. English-language deliverables (only on explicit client request) use `.md` without suffix.

| Agent | Output Type | Destination | Naming Convention (KR default: Korean) |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Industry Expert | Industry analysis reports, trend briefings | `deliverables/reports/` | `{topic}-industry-analysis-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Industry Expert | Regulatory overviews | `deliverables/research/` | `{topic}-regulatory-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Industry Expert | Source archives, regulatory documents | `deliverables/references/` | `{topic}-{source-type}-ref-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Strategy Analyst | Research findings, competitive analyses, financial models | `deliverables/research/` | `{topic}-{report-type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Strategy Analyst | Source data, financial filings, analyst reports | `deliverables/references/` | `{topic}-{source-type}-ref-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Data Analyst | Data analysis reports, model outputs | `deliverables/research/` | `{topic}-data-analysis-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Data Analyst | Raw data sources, dataset references | `deliverables/references/` | `{topic}-{source-type}-ref-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Subject Matter Expert | Functional analysis reports, benchmarking | `deliverables/research/` | `{topic}-{function}-analysis-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Subject Matter Expert | Reference documents, benchmarks | `deliverables/references/` | `{topic}-{source-type}-ref-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Change Management Partner | Culture statements, readiness assessments | `deliverables/research/` | `{topic}-change-assessment-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Change Management Partner | Assessment references | `deliverables/references/` | `{topic}-{source-type}-ref-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Communications Lead | Consulting reports, stakeholder comms | `deliverables/reports/` | `{deliverable-type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Communications Lead | Executive presentations | `deliverables/presentations/` | `{deck-title}-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Solutions Architect | Architecture documents, feasibility assessments | `deliverables/reports/` | `{topic}-architecture-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Workstream Lead | Status reports, execution plans, risk logs | `deliverables/drafts/` | `{workstream}-{report-type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Delivery Manager | Project status reports, stakeholder trackers | `deliverables/drafts/` | `delivery-{report-type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Communications Lead | Pre-sales proposal drafts and rendered proposals | `deliverables/proposals/` | `{prospect}-proposal-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` (draft) / `.pptx` (rendered) |
| Strategy Analyst | Pre-sales client requirements (structured, from RFP/briefing) | `deliverables/research/` | `{prospect}-requirements-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Solutions Architect | Pre-sales candidate architecture and delivery roadmap | `deliverables/research/` | `{prospect}-architecture-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md`, `{prospect}-roadmap-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |
| Data Analyst | Pre-sales cost estimate (labor + solution cost) | `deliverables/research/` | `{prospect}-cost-estimate-{YYYY-MM-DD}_ko.md` |

> **English deliverables**: When a client explicitly requests English output, use `{topic}-{report-type}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` (no `_ko` suffix).

## Domain Rules

1. All research findings must be logged to `memory/` with source citations.
2. Client-facing deliverables require Engagement Leader sign-off before distribution. **[CONSULT-R1]**
3. Stakeholder review comments must be tracked in the delivery coordination log.
4. Publication artifacts must be version-controlled before distribution.
5. Change management assessments must include organizational readiness scores.
6. All agent-produced deliverables MUST be saved to their designated output folder per the **Output Destination Mapping** table above. Agents MUST read this table before saving any file. Do not hard-code output paths in agent or skill definitions — this table is the single source of truth. Create the destination folder if it does not exist.
7. **Deliverable language follows the active country profile (KR default: Korean)**. Unless the client explicitly requests another language, all deliverables MUST be written in the default language and saved with the `_ko.md` file suffix (e.g., `semiconductor-trends-2026-06-28_ko.md`). English-language deliverables use `.md` without suffix only when requested.
8. Markdown deliverables in `deliverables/` can be converted to client-ready DOCX reports using `bun scripts/co-consult/md-to-report.ts <file.md>`. Output is saved alongside the source file (e.g., `report_ko.md` → `report_ko.docx`). Requires project dependency (`docx`) installed via `bun install`. PDF conversion is out of scope for this script — convert DOCX to PDF manually via Word or any office application.
9. Ingested quantitative market data MUST conform to `docs/market-data-schema.json` (canonical financial model: column, unit, and currency contract) before entering the KPI pipeline — `financial-kpi.ts`, `financial-driver-tree.ts`, and the `financial-modeling` skill consume only schema-valid canonical models. **[CONSULT-R2]**
9. Phase 1 research deliverables MUST pass cross-validation before entering `insight-synthesis`. PM dispatches validator agents per the Cross-Validation Matrix in [`engagement-orchestration.md`](engagement-orchestration.md). See Phase 1.5 Cross-Validation section for checklist and re-execution triggers.
10. **Korean-terminology reference assets are SSOT'd at `docs/terms-ko.json`** (workspace root — not per-skill). Any skill that needs a Korean-original ↔ English glossary (business/financial/corporate-research terms not covered by the workspace English-only doc policy) MUST read/link `docs/terms-ko.json` rather than maintaining a local `references/terms-ko.json` copy. Rationale: a skill-local copy is duplicated 4× across platform mirrors (`skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) and, when two or more skills need overlapping terms (e.g. `company-intelligence` and `financial-statement-analysis` both need financial-statement account names), those per-skill copies drift out of sync with no audit check catching it. Extending an entry: add it directly to `docs/terms-ko.json` under the relevant category (create a new category if none fits); do not add category duplicates. Currently consumed by: `company-intelligence`, `financial-statement-analysis`.
11. **Portfolio/backtest analytics is out-of-domain for co-consult.** OpenBB-class investment-portfolio capabilities (portfolio construction, strategy backtesting, factor-exposure analysis, P&L attribution, execution analytics) are deliberately NOT part of this variant. co-consult's financial scope is research- and analysis-shaped: company intelligence, financial-statement analysis, and business financial modeling for strategic recommendations, not investment-portfolio management. Operative rule: engagement requests that need portfolio/backtest analytics MUST be scoped out at engagement intake (Phase 1) and recorded in the engagement kickoff artifacts as an external dependency or a follow-up engagement - agents MUST NOT improvise portfolio analytics with `financial-modeling`; that skill models business outcomes (revenue, cost, valuation scenarios), not security portfolios. Decision record: `docs/variant-benchmark-backlog.md` §4, gap closed 2026-08-25 via the record-out-of-domain option (scoping a `portfolio-analytics` skill was rejected: no consulting-workflow consumer, OpenBB parity would drag a data-terminal dependency chain into a strategy variant).

<!-- COMMON-CONTEXT:START -->
This project follows the workspace coding standards defined in the project's Coding Guidelines section.

Key rules:
- All operational scripts must be TypeScript (`.ts`) — run via `bun scripts/<name>.ts` (ADR-0036; no `.sh`/`.ps1` pairs)
- Git hook scripts in `.githooks/` remain Unix shell (`.sh`) for git compatibility
- All text files saved as **UTF-8 (without BOM)**
- Commit messages and PR artifacts in **English only**
