# Team Configuration Guide

> Scenario-based guide for assembling the right team for each consulting engagement.

---

## Overview

The co-consult agent roster is designed to scale with engagement complexity. Not every project requires all agents. This guide provides **four configuration scenarios** based on project scope and complexity, plus principles for customizing team composition.

## Core Team vs. Extended Team

| Team Layer | Agents | Always Required? |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Core** | Engagement Leader | ✅ Always |
| **Core** | Strategy Analyst | ✅ Always (research-driven engagements) |
| **Core** | Communications Lead | ✅ Always (client deliverables) |
| **Extended** | Change Management Partner | When organizational change is involved |
| **Extended** | Solutions Architect | When technical solutions are required |
| **Extended** | Delivery Manager | When multi-workstream coordination is needed |
| **Extended** | Technology Specialist | When platform/tool implementation is needed |
| **Extended** | Workstream Lead | When 3+ parallel workstreams run simultaneously |
| **Specialist** | Industry Expert | When deep industry knowledge is critical |
| **Specialist** | Subject Matter Expert | When functional depth (HR, Finance, Ops) is required |
| **Specialist** | Data Analyst | When quantitative modeling or visualization is central |

## Scenario 1: Quick Assessment (Small Scope)

**Use when**: Single-topic diagnostic, feasibility study, or rapid market scan  
**Duration**: 1–2 weeks  
**Deliverable**: Research brief or short recommendation memo

### Team
```
Engagement Leader
└── Strategy Analyst
└── Communications Lead
```

### Phase Flow
| Phase | Lead Agent | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0 - Initiation | Engagement Leader | Scope definition |
| 1 - Research | Strategy Analyst | Findings brief |
| 3 - Content | Communications Lead | Recommendation memo |
| 6 - Handoff | Engagement Leader | Client delivery |

### When to Upgrade
- Client asks for change impact assessment → add Change Management Partner
- Technical feasibility needed → add Solutions Architect

---

## Scenario 2: Standard Consulting Engagement (Medium Scope)

**Use when**: Market entry analysis, operational improvement, or strategy development  
**Duration**: 4–8 weeks  
**Deliverable**: Full strategy report with implementation roadmap

### Team
```
Engagement Leader
├── Strategy Analyst
├── Change Management Partner
├── Communications Lead
├── Solutions Architect
└── Delivery Manager
```

### Phase Flow
| Phase | Lead Agent | Supporting Agents | Output |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| 0 - Initiation | Engagement Leader | — | Project charter |
| 1 - Research | Strategy Analyst | Change Management Partner | Market & org analysis |
| 2 - Design Review | Engagement Leader | Change Management Partner | Approved approach |
| 3 - Content | Communications Lead | Solutions Architect | Strategy report + technical specs |
| 4 - Delivery | Delivery Manager | — | Stakeholder review cycle |
| 5 - QA | Engagement Leader | — | Quality gate pass |
| 6 - Handoff | Engagement Leader | — | Final client delivery |

### When to Upgrade
- Multiple client business units → add Workstream Lead
- Industry benchmarking needed → add Industry Expert
- Data modeling required → add Data Analyst

---

## Scenario 3: Complex Transformation Program (Large Scope)

**Use when**: Digital transformation, large-scale restructuring, or multi-year program design  
**Duration**: 8–16 weeks  
**Deliverable**: Transformation roadmap, governance design, technical architecture, change management plan

### Team
```
Engagement Leader
├── Change Management Partner        [High Tier]
├── Industry Expert                  [High Tier]
├── Strategy Analyst                 [Medium Tier]
├── Subject Matter Expert            [Medium Tier]
├── Solutions Architect              [Medium Tier]
├── Workstream Lead                  [Medium Tier]
├── Communications Lead              [Medium Tier]
├── Data Analyst                     [Low Tier]
├── Delivery Manager                 [Low Tier]
└── Technology Specialist            [Low Tier]
```

### Workstream Structure
Run workstreams in parallel, each led by a dedicated agent:

| Workstream | Lead | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Strategy | Strategy Analyst | Market position, competitive analysis |
| Change | Change Management Partner | Org readiness, culture, leadership alignment |
| Technology | Solutions Architect | Architecture design, integration blueprint |
| Data | Data Analyst | Baseline metrics, KPI framework, modeling |
| Delivery | Workstream Lead | Cross-workstream coordination, dependency management |

### When to Reduce
- If change component is minimal → remove Change Management Partner
- If no technical architecture required → remove Solutions Architect

---

## Scenario 4: Specialized Expert Engagement

**Use when**: Client needs deep functional or industry expertise for a focused problem  
**Duration**: 2–4 weeks  
**Deliverable**: Expert assessment report with targeted recommendations

### Team (Industry-Focused)
```
Engagement Leader
├── Industry Expert
├── Strategy Analyst
└── Communications Lead
```

### Team (Functional-Focused)
```
Engagement Leader
├── Subject Matter Expert (e.g., HR or Finance)
├── Data Analyst
└── Communications Lead
```

### Phase Flow
| Phase | Lead Agent | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0 - Initiation | Engagement Leader | Scoped brief |
| 1 - Research | Industry/SME Expert + Strategy Analyst | Expert findings |
| 3 - Content | Communications Lead | Expert assessment report |
| 6 - Handoff | Engagement Leader | Client presentation |

## Team Assembly Principles

### 1. Start with the Core, Expand as Needed
Always begin with Engagement Leader + Strategy Analyst + Communications Lead. Add agents only when the engagement scope explicitly requires their expertise.

### 2. Role-Based, Not Headcount-Based
Avoid adding agents for perceived completeness. Each agent must have a defined deliverable and phase ownership. Idle agents create coordination overhead without value.

### 3. Tier Alignment
Match agent tier to task complexity:
- **High-tier agents** (Engagement Leader, Change Management Partner, Industry Expert): Strategic decisions, complex synthesis, executive interactions
- **Medium-tier agents** (Strategy Analyst, Solutions Architect, Communications Lead, SME, Workstream Lead): Analysis, design, content creation
- **Low-tier agents** (Delivery Manager, Technology Specialist, Data Analyst): Execution, logistics, tool implementation

### 4. Parallel vs. Sequential Dispatch
| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|------------|
| **Parallel** | Independent workstreams (e.g., research + change assessment) |
| **Sequential** | Dependent phases (e.g., research must complete before content creation) |

### 5. Governance Checkpoints
Regardless of scenario size, always include:
- **Phase 0**: Scope alignment and team confirmation with client
- **Phase 1.5**: Cross-validation of Phase 1 deliverables before synthesis (see [`engagement-orchestration.md`](engagement-orchestration.md))
- **Phase 2**: Design review and user/client approval gate before execution
- **Phase 5-6**: QA gate and formal handoff
