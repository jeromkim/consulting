## Context

Use in Phase 1 alongside competitive and technical analyses. The change management cost estimates produced here are mandatory inputs for the financial-modeling skill.

## When to Use

- When beginning a consulting engagement that involves organizational transformation
- Before any financial modeling that must account for change management costs
- When leadership asks for a realistic assessment of the organization's change capacity
- When resistance probability needs to be quantified for schedule planning

## Execution Steps

1. **Define Change Scope**: Clarify the nature and scale of the proposed change

2. **Leadership Alignment Assessment**:
   - Are senior leaders aligned on the need for change? (Score 1-5)
   - Is there a visible, committed executive sponsor? (Score 1-5)
   - Are middle managers equipped to lead change? (Score 1-5)

3. **Cultural Readiness Assessment**:
   - Does the organizational culture support experimentation and adaptation? (Score 1-5)
   - Are there past change failures that may create skepticism? (Yes/No + context)
   - What are the dominant cultural values and how do they align with the proposed change?

4. **Capability Gap Analysis**:
   - What skills/competencies are required by the change?
   - What is the current capability level? (Gap = Required - Current)
   - What training or hiring is needed?

5. **Change Management Cost Estimation**:
   - Training and upskilling cost range
   - Change agent/program management resource cost
   - Communication campaign budget
   - Schedule delay buffer (weeks × team cost, given resistance probability)
   - **Total change management cost range** (this is the mandatory output for financial-modeling)

6. **Overall Readiness Score**: Weighted average across dimensions.
   - Low: < 3.0
   - Medium: 3.0–3.9
   - High: ≥ 4.0

## Output Format

- **Readiness Scorecard**: Dimension, Score (1-5), Key Evidence, Risk Flag
- **Capability Gap Table**: Competency, Required Level, Current Level, Gap, Recommended Action
- **Change Management Cost Estimate**: Category, Low Estimate, High Estimate, Assumptions
- **Overall Readiness Summary**: Score, Interpretation, Top 3 Risks, Recommended Change Approach
